        Transformation in retail was already underway before the pandemic and is
        now accelerating, powered by data and AI. The good news is that
        retailers can now access the innovation, skills and solutions required
        to fully embrace AI responsibly across the enterprise to create value
        and fuel profitability. Working side-by-side with businesses, N2N.ai has
        made artificial intelligence with practical, everyday applications is no
        longer the stuff of science fiction. AI is already being employed by
        thousands of businesses of all sizes today to help them do business
        faster and less expensively or to develop an edge over the competition.

        We are reaching the peak of the hype curve with artificial intelligence
        (AI) in retail. The vast majority of retailers agree it will continue to
        transform the retail industry and redefine financial and operational
        benchmarks for success. The competitive landscape is shifting and it’s
        no longer about just pursuing AI—it’s about being among the first to
        adopt AI at scale to reach unprecedented levels of personalization,
        precision and profitability.

        Most people don’t think about AI when they talk about the “digital
        transformation” of the retail industry. The first things that come to
        mind for most people are robots replacing workers and the efficiencies
        derived from a universally available internet together with the ubiquity
        and sophistication of modern database systems. But sophisticated AI
        systems are no longer limited to the labs of academia or high-tech
        giants like IBM and Google. A wide variety of purpose-built AI
        technologies, provided by company likes N2N.ai, are available today to
        “rent” or buy, including a growing number of “machine learning systems”
        that help retailers improve their operations and better understand
        customer behaviours in order to improve their marketing efforts.
