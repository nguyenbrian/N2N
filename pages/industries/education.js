              Education can be defined as a process where teachers and students
              give and receive systematic instructions, respectively. Learning
              can take place in either a formal or informal setting. More
              commonly, students receive education in a formal setting such as a
              high-school, college, university, etc. Education is often
              considered as a significant determinant of an individual’s future
              success rate. Justifiably, there are various efforts to improve
              the current education systems in multiple countries worldwide.

              Among the many methods employed by various countries to improve
              the education sector includes the use of AI (Artificial
              intelligence). AI systems are defined by the use of computers to
              accomplish tasks that had previously required human intellect. AI
              utilizes algorithms that collect, classify, organize, and analyze
              information to conclude it, which is also called machine learning.
              As such, the use of machine learning has the potential to bring
              about several benefits for the various industries, including the
              education system.

              Traditional education systems are fast changing to adapt to the
              technological advancements of today’s world. This is especially
              true with the widespread access to various educational sources of
              information online. The implementation of educational AI systems
              has the potential to help students develop their skills and
              acquire more knowledge in multiple subjects. Therefore, as
              artificial intelligence continues to evolve, it is our hope that
              it can help fill the gaps in the education system.

              Digital Transformation means enhancing an organization’s core
              business operations to meet customer requirements efficiently by
              leveraging data and technology. In the education industry, the
              target customer can be student, faculty, staff and alumni and
              digitizing the education sector can benefit both students and
              faculty. With the digitization of the learning experience, both
              students and teachers can enhance their skills to create an
              engaging educational process. From online learning to the smart
              classroom, analysis of students’ performance, personalized
              learning experience and online examination, you can transform your
              educational institute in many ways.

              Artificial intelligence (AI) has become intertwined with our
              lives. From automated parking mechanisms to surveillance and
              personal assistants to autonomous flights, AI is all around us.
              And as this technology continues to impact these sectors of human
              existence, education isn’t lagging either. The world of learning
              is becoming more convenient and customized thanks to the many
              applications of AI. This technology cuts across the divide,
              bringing innovative and effective transformations that benefit
              learners, educators, and educational establishments.

              Educators from all grade-levels are coming to realize the benefits
              of technology in the classroom. Typically, education is one of the
              last industries to make extensive change, holding on to antiquated
              methods and practices. But through the digital transformation and
              the rise of educational technology, teachers have begun making
              drastic changes to their instruction, assessments, even the
              physical make-up of their classrooms, and at a much faster rate
              than expected.
