              Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the best technology
              supporting the transportation industry in many ways. It was a
              proven technology that transforms the transportation sector
              tremendously. In addition to making our lives easier, Artificial
              intelligence technology helps to make all modes of human
              transportation system safer and more efficient.

              AI in logistics has undergone significant transformation over the
              years. With many companies in supply chain and logistics
              undergoing a digital transformation, the influence of new
              technology is accelerating at considerable speed. In order to
              remain successful and maintain a competitive advantage in the
              field, companies know that it’s essential to leverage AI and Big
              Data into day-to-day operations. AI play a significant role to
              save time, reduce costs and increase productivity and accuracy
              with cognitive automation. AI affects warehousing operations such
              as collecting and analyzing information or inventory processing.
              As a result, AI helps in increasing efficiency and getting profit.

              AI technologies can access information such as billing amounts,
              account information, dates, addresses, and parties involved from
              the sea of unstructured invoice forms received by the company.
              Global logistics and supply chain operators manage large fleets of
              vehicles and networks of facilities worldwide. In the logistics
              industry, keeping address information complete and current is
              critical for the successful delivery of shipments.

              With the introduction of AI in transportation, the industry has
              progressed in such a level that vehicles are moving without any
              assistance from humans. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI).
              Artificial intelligence technology in transportation is helping
              the industry to enhance safety, reduce unexpected accidents,
              reduce traffic, carbon emission and also lower the complete
              financial expenses. On businesses front, artificial intelligence
              in transportation helps to increase productivity, employee
              performance, more sales, and automated manufacturing processes,
              etc.
