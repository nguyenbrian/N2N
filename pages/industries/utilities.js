        Digital transformation in the utilities sector is the process of
        adopting new digital ways of working, often with a business goal for
        utilities to reinvent themselves. Common business goals include improved
        interactions with customers, more streamlined operations, greater
        efficiencies, and hopes of triggering new business models.

      <b>Business is benefit of digital transformation in utilities:</b>
      <p>
        Although transformation has been slow to arrive for the utility sector,
        those companies that do implement digital technologies and adopt news
        ways of working can benefit greatly. Utility executives using expert
        systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), for example, can gain new
        business insights and optimize processes by analyzing large data sets
        quickly. Safety, regulatory and compliance-based systems can be improved
        by helping employees better monitor and control policies. Meanwhile and
        of significant importance, digital transformation can help utilities
        improve customer service operations and explore new business models.
        This can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn and lead to new
        products and services.
