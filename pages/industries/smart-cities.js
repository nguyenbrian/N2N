        AI can combine with massive amounts of data to transform how a city
        operates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent growth in digital technologies is enabling cities to undergo
        transformations for streamlining smart services and offering new
        products. Digitization has changed the way citizens and stakeholders
        live, work, collaborate, and communicate. This disruptive change
        inter-connects with all information systems and processes that are
        important for providing services. Although digital transformation
        present opportunities for achieving smart cities, municipalities still
        struggle with managing data integration and complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        An integrated approach to the Internet of Things (IoT), connectivity,
        Artificial intelligence (AI), distributed computing and other
        technologies is required to transform cities into smart cities. Cities
        of a nation form pillars of the economic growth of that nation, but they
        can become unmanageable due to various factors like overpopulation,
        undelivered or underdelivered critical services. Such factors can lead
        to a point where the cities become an unpleasant place to be. Therefore,
        the idea that smart cities are needed to make cities a beacon of
        opportunities and economic growth is being realized worldwide. What
        makes a city a “smart city” is not just the degree of technology
        advancements that the city is abreast with. N2N.ai provides an
        integrated approach to technology implementation can help relieve
        particular challenges like parking and traffic management, street
        lighting, energy consumption, and public safety.

        While the use cases of Smart City technologies promise to revolutionise
        the way we live in our urban areas, both organisations in the public
        sector procuring these systems and in the private sector developing them
        will need to take account of the unique implications of this new
        technology and navigate the data privacy and AI risks with good
        governance measures. N2N.ai is familiar with implementing these measures
        for our clients and hope to have left you with some useful “food for
        thought” for your own AI implementation strategy.

        What has been exposed by the Covid-19 crisis is that the historic
        independent silo development of many city departments – be it public
        safety, health care, e-government, communications, transportation, power
        and water, municipal services, environmental and logistics – have not
        been able to collaborate and adapt fast enough to protect their
        citizens. The digital transformation of city services is required, where
        information and situational awareness is readily available from all
        required sources in near real-time to make informed decisions.
