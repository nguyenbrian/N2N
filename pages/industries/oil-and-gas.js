                  Overcoming Digitization Challenges in the Oil and Gas Industry
                  - Oil and Gas Industry Transforming Itself with the Help of AI

            <p>
              In the oil and gas industry, digitalization is improving project
              economics and streamlining operations, with AI as the key for
              sustainable growth and security against cyberthreats.
            </p>

            <p>
              For oil and gas companies, digital transformation is a
              priority—not only as a way to modernize the enterprise, but also
              to secure the entire energy ecosystem. With that lens, the urgency
              of applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
              capabilities for optimization and cybersecurity becomes clear,
              especially as threat actors increasingly target connected devices
              and operating systems, putting the oil and gas industry in
              collective danger. The year-over-year explosion in
              industry-specific attacks underscores the need for meaningful
              advancements and maturity in cybersecurity programs.
            </p>

            <p>
              To navigate today’s volatile business landscape, oil and gas
              companies need to simultaneously identify optimization
              opportunities and cybersecurity gaps in their digitalization
              strategies. That means building AI and cybersecurity into digital
              deployments from the ground up, not bolting them on afterward.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, most companies don’t have the resources to implement
              sophisticated AI programs to stay secure and advance digital
              capabilities on their own. Irrespective of size, available budget,
              and in-house personnel, all energy companies must manage
              operations and security fundamentals to ensure they have
              visibility and monitoring across powerful digital tools to remain
              resilient and competitive. The achievement of that goal is much
              more likely in partnership with the right experts like N2N.ai.
