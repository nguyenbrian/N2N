        The latest digital manufacturing trends are aimed at connecting physical
        and virtual factory environments to boost productivity, efficiency and
        profitability.

        Evolution of the manufacturing industry can be seen with the
        implementation of <b>Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</b>. This is
        to minimize the human workforce while improve efficiency and simplify
        the whole manufacturing system. If earlier, more than one person was
        required to manage one task system, then with the implementation of
        AI-based robots, now one bot per task system is sufficient. We are going
        to see very soon 
        <b>
          what roles AI and robotics are playing in the manufacturing industry
        </b>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        AI is the reason behind evolution in the manufacturing industry. They
        are making production decisions smarter and instant. Nowadays people
        prefer customized products over costly industrially produced products. 
        <b>With the help of N2N.ai, labor cost can be minimized</b>. AI is the
        next step after robotics for improving productivity and minimization of
        cost of production. The main causes behind the logical evolution of
        industries are poor demand and capacity planning, unsafe workplaces i.e.
        workers are exposed to essential harmful products used in factories,
        inefficiency, longer and costlier production etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>
          Artificial Intelligence is highly essential for the survival and
          improvement of the industries
        </b>
        . Robots play a highly important role in the production, packing, and
        shipping of products with least manual help. Artificial intelligence and
        robotics, in collaboration with new technology like 3D printing, will
        prove beneficial in bringing advancement in manufacturing and fulfilling
        increasing consumer demands.
