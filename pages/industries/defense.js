              The rise of digital platforms is empowering the military, enabling
              better continuity of operations and bringing armed forces at a new
              level of combat readiness. However, the Digital Transformation is
              also bringing new players into the marketplace, where traditional
              industries have been used for decades to well-established business
              and working processes. From now on, a progressive impregnation of
              commercial services is witnessed across the military, with a
              growing appetite for SaaS models, ready for deployment, data
              monetization and pay as you go types of services, due to
              constrained defence budgets.

            <p>
              Digital transformation of the military ecosystem has started its
              journey, shifting traditional working processes, operations and
              level of services with a deep impact on delivering military
              capabilities. Digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things
              (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big Data, Data Analytics, Artificial
              Intelligence, Augmented Reality, and Blockchain are being
              progressively leveraged at both the agency and operational levels
              to ease workflow and bring more efficiency to missions.

              The technologies of the defense industry are in the early stages
              of a seismic shift: artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are
              changing defense now and will enable intelligent warfare in the
              decades to come. These technologies will have a correspondingly
              tectonic effect on defense contractors. In the near term,
              incorporating AI into the design of traditional battle networks
              will vastly improve performance of current platforms and forces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Robotics and AI technologies are on the brink of reshaping
              defense, and it is relying more and more on technologies from
              commercial players outside the defense industry. Without
              deliberate moves to compete in the emerging AI and robotics
              spaces, traditional defense contractors face a downward spiral of
              disruption and declining relevance. The good news is that, in
              terms of market insights and data, traditional contractors should
              have a structural advantage over new entrants. But to avoid
              segment retreat and win in these emerging markets, they need to
              take deliberate steps to capitalize on their advantages, starting
              today.Â
