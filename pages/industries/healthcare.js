        Digital transformation is an ongoing process and new trends are emerging
        in the healthcare industry with each passing day. When you pursue
        digital transformation in healthcare, you need to think beyond the
        technology needed to drive innovation. Digital transformation in
        healthcare is a building block of a patient-focused approach to
        healthcare. It will help healthcare providers streamline operations,
        understand what the patient requires, build loyalty and trust and offer
        a better seamless patient experience.

        Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform how
        healthcare is delivered. A joint report with the European Union’s EIT
        Health explores how it can support improvements in care outcomes,
        patient experience and access to healthcare services. It can increase
        productivity and the efficiency of care delivery and allow healthcare
        systems to provide more and better care to more people. N2N.ai can
        provide AI solutions to help improve the experience of healthcare
        practitioners, enabling them to spend more time in direct patient care
        and reducing burnout.

        Healthcare providers all over the world are faced with a single
        challenge: the need to improve patient outcomes while containing costs.
        Drivers include an increasing demand for chronic disease management for
        an aging population, technological advancements and empowered patients
        taking control of their health experience. The digital transformation in
        healthcare, through the creation of a rich health data foundation and
        integration of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced
        analytics, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), is
        recognized as a key component to tackle these challenges. It can lead to
        improvements in diagnostics, prevention and patient therapy, ultimately
        empowering care givers to use an evidence-based approach to improve
        clinical decisions. The emerging technologies provided by N2N.ai that
        enable this goal must be extensible, safe, reliable, and affordable and
        tailored to the digitalization maturity-level of the individual
        organization.
